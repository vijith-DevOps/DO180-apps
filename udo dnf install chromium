[1mBASH BUILTIN COMMANDS[0m
       Unless  otherwise  noted,  each  builtin  command documented in this section as accepting options preceded by [1m-[0m
       accepts [1m-- [22mto signify the end of the options.  The [1m:[22m, [1mtrue[22m, [1mfalse[22m, and [1mtest [22mbuiltins do not accept options  and
       do  not  treat  [1m--  [22mspecially.   The  [1mexit[22m, [1mlogout[22m, [1mreturn[22m, [1mbreak[22m, [1mcontinue[22m, [1mlet[22m, and [1mshift [22mbuiltins accept and
       process arguments beginning with [1m- [22mwithout requiring [1m--[22m.  Other builtins that  accept  arguments  but  are  not
       specified  as  accepting options interpret arguments beginning with [1m- [22mas invalid options and require [1m-- [22mto pre‚Äê
       vent this interpretation.
       [1m: [22m[[4marguments[24m]
              No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding [4marguments[24m and  performing  any  specified  redirec‚Äê
              tions.  The return status is zero.

       [1msource [4m[22mfilename[24m [[4marguments[24m]
              Read  and  execute commands from [4mfilename[24m in the current shell environment and return the exit status of
              the last command executed from [4mfilename[24m.  If [4mfilename[24m does not contain a slash, filenames  in  [1mPATH  [22mare
              used  to  find the directory containing [4mfilename[24m.  The file searched for in [1mPATH [22mneed not be executable.
              When [1mbash [22mis not in [4mposix[24m [4mmode[24m, the current directory is searched if no file is found in [1mPATH[22m.   If  the
              [1msourcepath  [22moption  to  the [1mshopt [22mbuiltin command is turned off, the [1mPATH [22mis not searched.  If any [4margu‚Äê[0m
              [4mments[24m are supplied, they become the positional parameters when  [4mfilename[24m  is  executed.   Otherwise  the
              positional parameters are unchanged.  If the [1m-T [22moption is enabled, [1msource [22minherits any trap on [1mDEBUG[22m; if
              it is not, any [1mDEBUG [22mtrap string is saved and restored around the call to [1msource[22m, and [1msource [22munsets  the
              [1mDEBUG  [22mtrap  while  it executes.  If [1m-T [22mis not set, and the sourced file changes the [1mDEBUG [22mtrap, the new
              value is retained when [1msource [22mcompletes.  The return status is the status of  the  last  command  exited
              within the script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if [4mfilename[24m is not found or cannot be read.

       [1malias [22m[[1m-p[22m] [[4mname[24m[=[4mvalue[24m] ...]
              [1mAlias [22mwith no arguments or with the [1m-p [22moption prints the list of aliases in the form [1malias [4m[22mname[24m=[4mvalue[24m on
              standard output.  When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each [4mname[24m whose [4mvalue[24m  is  given.
              A  trailing  space  in [4mvalue[24m causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is
              expanded.  For each [4mname[24m in the argument list for which no [4mvalue[24m is supplied, the name and value of  the
              alias is printed.  [1mAlias [22mreturns true unless a [4mname[24m is given for which no alias has been defined.

       [1mbg [22m[[4mjobspec[24m ...]
              Resume  each  suspended  job [4mjobspec[24m in the background, as if it had been started with [1m&[22m.  If [4mjobspec[24m is
              not present, the shell's notion of the [4mcurrent[24m [4mjob[24m is used.  [1mbg [4m[22mjobspec[24m returns 0 unless  run  when  job
              control  is  disabled  or, when run with job control enabled, any specified [4mjobspec[24m was not found or was
              started without job control.

       [1mbuiltin [4m[22mshell-builtin[24m [[4marguments[24m]
              Execute  the  specified shell builtin, passing it [4marguments[24m, and return its exit status.  This is useful
              when defining a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the functionality  of  the
              builtin within the function.  The [1mcd [22mbuiltin is commonly redefined this way.  The return status is false

              extra information may be used, for example, to print a stack trace.  The current frame is frame 0.   The
              return  value  is 0 unless the shell is not executing a subroutine call or [4mexpr[24m does not correspond to a
              valid position in the call stack.

              the  default.   Any  additional  arguments  following  [4mdir[24m are ignored.  The variable [1mCDPATH [22mdefines the
              search path for the directory containing [4mdir[24m: each directory name in [1mCDPATH [22mis searched for [4mdir[24m.  Alter‚Äê

              same as the current directory, i.e., ``[1m.[22m''.  If [4mdir[24m begins with a slash (/), then [1mCDPATH  [22mis  not  used.
              The  [1m-P  [22moption  causes  [1mcd  [22mto  use  the physical directory structure by resolving symbolic links while
              traversing [4mdir[24m and before processing instances of [4m..[24m in [4mdir[24m (see also the [1m-P [22moption to the  [1mset  [22mbuiltin
              command);  the  [1m-L  [22moption  forces  symbolic links to be followed by resolving the link after processing
              instances of [4m..[24m in [4mdir[24m.  If [4m..[24m appears in [4mdir[24m, it is processed  by  removing  the  immediately  previous
              pathname component from [4mdir[24m, back to a slash or the beginning of [4mdir[24m.  If the [1m-e [22moption is supplied with
              [1m-P[22m, and the current working directory cannot be successfully determined  after  a  successful  directory
              change,  [1mcd  [22mwill return an unsuccessful status.  On systems that support it, the [1m-@ [22moption presents the
              extended attributes associated with a file as a directory.  An argument of [1m-  [22mis  converted  to  [1m$OLDPWD[0m
              before the directory change is attempted.  If a non-empty directory name from [1mCDPATH [22mis used, or if [1m- [22mis
              the first argument, and the directory change is successful, the absolute pathname  of  the  new  working
              directory is written to the standard output.  The return value is true if the directory was successfully
              changed; false otherwise.

              description.   If  the  [1m-V [22mor [1m-v [22moption is supplied, the exit status is 0 if [4mcommand[24m was found, and 1 if
              not.  If neither option is supplied and an error occurred or [4mcommand[24m cannot be found, the exit status is

              The  process  of applying these completion specifications when word completion is attempted is described
              above under [1mProgrammable Completion[22m.

              Enable and disable builtin shell commands.  Disabling a builtin allows a disk command which has the same
              name as a shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even though  the  shell  nor‚Äê
              mally  searches  for  builtins  before  disk commands.  If [1m-n [22mis used, each [4mname[24m is disabled; otherwise,
              [4mnames[24m are enabled.  For example, to use the [1mtest [22mbinary found via the [1mPATH [22minstead of the shell  builtin
              version,  run  ``enable -n test''.  The [1m-f [22moption means to load the new builtin command [4mname[24m from shared
              object [4mfilename[24m, on systems that support dynamic loading.  The [1m-d [22moption will delete  a  builtin  previ‚Äê
              ously  loaded with [1m-f[22m.  If no [4mname[24m arguments are given, or if the [1m-p [22moption is supplied, a list of shell
              builtins is printed.  With no other option arguments, the list consists of all enabled  shell  builtins.
              If [1m-n [22mis supplied, only disabled builtins are printed.  If [1m-a [22mis supplied, the list printed includes all
              builtins, with an indication of whether or not each is enabled.   If  [1m-s  [22mis  supplied,  the  output  is
              restricted to the POSIX [4mspecial[24m builtins.  The return value is 0 unless a [4mname[24m is not a shell builtin or
              there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared object.

       [1meval [22m[[4marg[24m ...]
              The [4marg[24ms are read and concatenated together into a single command.  This command is then read  and  exe‚Äê
              cuted by the shell, and its exit status is returned as the value of [1meval[22m.  If there are no [4margs[24m, or only
              null arguments, [1meval [22mreturns 0.

              If [4mcommand[24m is specified, it replaces the shell.  No new process is created.  The  [4marguments[24m  become  the
              arguments  to  [4mcommand[24m.   If  the [1m-l [22moption is supplied, the shell places a dash at the beginning of the
              zeroth argument passed to [4mcommand[24m.  This is what [4mlogin[24m(1) does.  The [1m-c [22moption causes [4mcommand[24m to be exe‚Äê
              cuted with an empty environment.  If [1m-a [22mis supplied, the shell passes [4mname[24m as the zeroth argument to the
              executed command.  If [4mcommand[24m cannot be executed for some reason, a non-interactive shell exits,  unless
              the  [1mexecfail  [22mshell option is enabled.  In that case, it returns failure.  An interactive shell returns
              failure if the file cannot be executed.  If [4mcommand[24m is not specified, any redirections  take  effect  in
              the current shell, and the return status is 0.  If there is a redirection error, the return status is 1.

              The  first  form  selects  a  range of commands from [4mfirst[24m to [4mlast[24m from the history list and displays or
              edits and re-executes them.  [4mFirst[24m and [4mlast[24m may be specified as a string (to  locate  the  last  command
              beginning  with  that string) or as a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number is
              used as an offset from the current command number).  If [4mlast[24m is not specified it is set to  the  current
              command  for  listing  (so  that  ``fc -l -10'' prints the last 10 commands) and to [4mfirst[24m otherwise.  If
              [4mfirst[24m is not specified it is set to the previous command for editing and -16 for listing.

              The [1m-n [22moption suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The [1m-r [22moption reverses the order of the com‚Äê
              mands.   If  the  [1m-l [22moption is given, the commands are listed on standard output.  Otherwise, the editor
              given by [4mename[24m is invoked on a file containing those commands.  If [4mename[24m is not given, the value of  the
              [1mFCEDIT  [22mvariable  is used, and the value of [1mEDITOR [22mif [1mFCEDIT [22mis not set.  If neither variable is set, [4mvi[0m
              is used.  When editing is complete, the edited commands are echoed and executed.

              In the second form, [4mcommand[24m is re-executed after each instance of [4mpat[24m is replaced by  [4mrep[24m.   [4mCommand[24m  is
              intepreted  the  same  as [4mfirst[24m above.  A useful alias to use with this is ``r="fc -s"'', so that typing
              ``r cc'' runs the last command beginning with ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the last command.

              If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid option is  encountered  or  [4mfirst[24m  or
              [4mlast[24m specify history lines out of range.  If the [1m-e [22moption is supplied, the return value is the value of
              the last command executed or failure if an error occurs with the temporary file  of  commands.   If  the
              second form is used, the return status is that of the command re-executed, unless [4mcmd[24m does not specify a
              valid history line, in which case [1mfc [22mreturns failure.

       [1mfg [22m[[4mjobspec[24m]
              Resume [4mjobspec[24m in the foreground, and make it the current job.  If [4mjobspec[24m is not present,  the  shell's
              notion  of the [4mcurrent[24m [4mjob[24m is used.  The return value is that of the command placed into the foreground,
              or failure if run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled,  if  [4mjobspec[24m  does
              not specify a valid job or [4mjobspec[24m specifies a job that was started without job control.

       [1mgetopts [4m[22moptstring[24m [4mname[24m [[4margs[24m]
              [1mgetopts [22mis used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters.  [4moptstring[24m contains the option char‚Äê
              acters to be recognized; if a character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an  argu‚Äê
              ment,  which should be separated from it by white space.  The colon and question mark characters may not
              be used as option characters.  Each time it is invoked, [1mgetopts [22mplaces the  next  option  in  the  shell
              variable  [4mname[24m,  initializing  [4mname[24m  if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to be pro‚Äê
              cessed into the variable [1mOPTIND[22m.  [1mOPTIND [22mis initialized to 1 each time the shell or a  shell  script  is
              invoked.   When  an  option requires an argument, [1mgetopts [22mplaces that argument into the variable [1mOPTARG[22m.
              The shell does not reset [1mOPTIND [22mautomatically; it must be  manually  reset  between  multiple  calls  to
              [1mgetopts [22mwithin the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.

              When  the end of options is encountered, [1mgetopts [22mexits with a return value greater than zero.  [1mOPTIND [22mis
              set to the index of the first non-option argument, and [4mname[24m is set to ?.

              [1mgetopts [22mnormally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments  are  given  in  [4margs[24m,  [1mgetopts[0m
              parses those instead.

              [1mgetopts  [22mcan  report  errors  in two ways.  If the first character of [4moptstring[24m is a colon, [4msilent[24m error
              reporting is used.  In normal operation, diagnostic messages are printed when invalid options or missing
              option  arguments  are  encountered.  If the variable [1mOPTERR [22mis set to 0, no error messages will be dis‚Äê
              played, even if the first character of [4moptstring[24m is not a colon.

              If an invalid option is seen, [1mgetopts [22mplaces ? into [4mname[24m and, if not silent, prints an error message and
              unsets  [1mOPTARG[22m.   If [1mgetopts [22mis silent, the option character found is placed in [1mOPTARG [22mand no diagnostic
              message is printed.

              If a required argument is not found, and [1mgetopts [22mis not silent, a question mark ([1m?[22m) is placed  in  [4mname[24m,
              [1mOPTARG  [22mis unset, and a diagnostic message is printed.  If [1mgetopts [22mis silent, then a colon ([1m:[22m) is placed
              in [4mname[24m and [1mOPTARG [22mis set to the option character found.

              [1mgetopts [22mreturns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found.  It returns false if the  end  of
              options is encountered or an error occurs.

              Each time [1mhash [22mis invoked, the full pathname of the command [4mname[24m is determined by searching the directo‚Äê

              option causes the shell to forget all remembered locations.  The [1m-d [22moption causes the  shell  to  forget
              the  remembered  location  of  each [4mname[24m.  If the [1m-t [22moption is supplied, the full pathname to which each

              before  the  hashed  full pathname.  The [1m-l [22moption causes output to be displayed in a format that may be

              Write  the  formatted  [4marguments[24m  to the standard output under the control of the [4mformat[24m.  The [1m-v [22moption
              causes the output to be assigned to the variable [4mvar[24m rather than being printed to the standard output.

              The [4mformat[24m is a character string which contains three types of objects: plain characters, which are sim‚Äê
              ply  copied  to standard output, character escape sequences, which are converted and copied to the stan‚Äê
              dard output, and format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next  successive  [4margument[24m.
              In addition to the standard [4mprintf[24m(1) format specifications, [1mprintf [22minterprets the following extensions:
              [1m%b     [22mcauses  [1mprintf [22mto expand backslash escape sequences in the corresponding [4margument[24m in the same way
                     as [1mecho -e[22m.
              [1m%q     [22mcauses [1mprintf [22mto output the corresponding [4margument[24m in a format that can be reused as shell input.
              [1m%([4m[22mdatefmt[24m[1m)T[0m
                     causes [1mprintf [22mto output the date-time string resulting from using [4mdatefmt[24m as a format string  for
                     [4mstrftime[24m(3).   The  corresponding [4margument[24m is an integer representing the number of seconds since
                     the epoch.  Two special argument values may be used: -1 represents the current time, and -2  rep‚Äê
                     resents the time the shell was invoked.  If no argument is specified, conversion behaves as if -1
                     had been given.  This is an exception to the usual [1mprintf [22mbehavior.

              Arguments to non-string format specifiers are treated as C constants, except  that  a  leading  plus  or
              minus  sign is allowed, and if the leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the ASCII
              value of the following character.

              The [4mformat[24m is reused as necessary to consume all of the [4marguments[24m.  If the [4mformat[24m  requires  more  [4margu‚Äê[0m
              [4mments[24m  than  are  supplied, the extra format specifications behave as if a zero value or null string, as
              appropriate, had been supplied.  The return value is zero on success, non-zero on failure.

              0 arguments
                     The expression is false.
              1 argument
                     The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null.
              2 arguments
                     If  the  first  argument is [1m![22m, the expression is true if and only if the second argument is null.
                     If the first argument is one of the unary conditional operators listed  above  under  [1mCONDITIONAL[0m
                     [1mEXPRESSIONS[22m,  the  expression  is true if the unary test is true.  If the first argument is not a
                     valid unary conditional operator, the expression is false.
              3 arguments
                     The following conditions are applied in the order listed.  If the second argument is one  of  the
                     binary  conditional  operators  listed  above  under  [1mCONDITIONAL  EXPRESSIONS[22m, the result of the
                     expression is the result of the binary test using the first and third arguments as operands.  The
                     [1m-a [22mand [1m-o [22moperators are considered binary operators when there are three arguments.  If the first
                     argument is [1m![22m, the value is the negation of the two-argument test  using  the  second  and  third
                     arguments.  If the first argument is exactly [1m( [22mand the third argument is exactly [1m)[22m, the result is
                     the one-argument test of the second argument.  Otherwise, the expression is false.
              4 arguments
                     If the first argument is [1m![22m, the result is the negation of the three-argument expression  composed
                     of  the  remaining  arguments.   Otherwise,  the  expression is parsed and evaluated according to
                     precedence using the rules listed above.
              5 or more arguments
                     The expression is parsed and evaluated according to precedence using the rules listed above.

              When used with [1mtest [22mor [1m[[22m, the [1m< [22mand [1m> [22moperators sort lexicographically using ASCII ordering.

       [1mtrap [22m[[1m-lp[22m] [[[4marg[24m] [4msigspec[24m ...]
              The  command [4marg[24m is to be read and executed when the shell receives signal(s) [4msigspec[24m.  If [4marg[24m is absent
              (and there is a single [4msigspec[24m) or [1m-[22m, each specified signal is reset to its  original  disposition  (the
              value  it  had  upon  entrance  to  the  shell).  If [4marg[24m is the null string the signal specified by each
              [4msigspec[24m is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.  If [4marg[24m is not present and [1m-p  [22mhas  been
              supplied,  then  the trap commands associated with each [4msigspec[24m are displayed.  If no arguments are sup‚Äê
              plied or if only [1m-p [22mis given, [1mtrap [22mprints the list of commands associated  with  each  signal.   The  [1m-l[0m
              option  causes  the shell to print a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers.  Each [4msigspec[0m
              is either a signal name defined in <[4msignal.h[24m>, or a signal number.  Signal names  are  case  insensitive
              and the [1mSIG [22mprefix is optional.

              If a [4msigspec[24m is [1mEXIT [22m(0) the command [4marg[24m is executed on exit from the shell.  If a [4msigspec[24m is [1mDEBUG[22m, the
              command [4marg[24m is executed before every [4msimple[24m [4mcommand[24m, [4mfor[24m command, [4mcase[24m command,  [4mselect[24m  command,  every
              arithmetic  [4mfor[24m  command,  and  before the first command executes in a shell function (see [1mSHELL GRAMMAR[0m
              above).  Refer to the description of the [1mextdebug [22moption to the [1mshopt [22mbuiltin for details of its  effect
              on  the [1mDEBUG [22mtrap.  If a [4msigspec[24m is [1mRETURN[22m, the command [4marg[24m is executed each time a shell function or a
              script executed with the [1m. [22mor [1msource [22mbuiltins finishes executing.

              If a [4msigspec[24m is [1mERR[22m, the command [4marg[24m is executed whenever a pipeline (which may consist of a single sim‚Äê
              ple  command),  a  list,  or a compound command returns a non-zero exit status, subject to the following
              conditions.  The [1mERR [22mtrap is not executed if the failed command is part of the command list  immediately
              following a [1mwhile [22mor [1muntil [22mkeyword, part of the test in an [4mif[24m statement, part of a command executed in a
              [1m&& [22mor [1m|| [22mlist except the command following the final [1m&& [22mor [1m||[22m, any command in a pipeline but  the  last,
              or if the command's return value is being inverted using [1m![22m.  These are the same conditions obeyed by the
              [1merrexit [22m([1m-e[22m) option.

              Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped, reset or listed.  Trapped  signals  that  are
              not  being  ignored are reset to their original values in a subshell or subshell environment when one is
              created.  The return status is false if any [4msigspec[24m is invalid; otherwise [1mtrap [22mreturns true.

              is an alias, shell reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file, respectively.  If  the  [4mname[24m  is  not
              found, then nothing is printed, and an exit status of false is returned.  If the [1m-p [22moption is used, [1mtype[0m
              either returns the name of the disk file that would be executed if [4mname[24m  were  specified  as  a  command
              name, or nothing if ``type -t name'' would not return [4mfile[24m.  The [1m-P [22moption forces a [1mPATH [22msearch for each
              [4mname[24m, even if ``type -t name'' would not return [4mfile[24m.  If a command is  hashed,  [1m-p  [22mand  [1m-P  [22mprint  the
              hashed  value,  which is not necessarily the file that appears first in [1mPATH[22m.  If the [1m-a [22moption is used,
              [1mtype [22mprints all of the places that contain an executable named [4mname[24m.  This includes  aliases  and  func‚Äê
              tions,  if  and  only  if the [1m-p [22moption is not also used.  The table of hashed commands is not consulted
              when using [1m-a[22m.  The [1m-f [22moption suppresses shell function lookup,  as  with  the  [1mcommand  [22mbuiltin.   [1mtype[0m
              returns true if all of the arguments are found, false if any are not found.

              Provides  control  over  the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems
              that allow such control.  The [1m-H [22mand [1m-S [22moptions specify that the hard or soft limit is set for the given

              ues; and, when in Posix mode, [1m-c [22mand [1m-f[22m, which are in 512-byte  increments.   The  return  status  is  0
              unless  an  invalid  option  or  argument is supplied, or an error occurs while setting a new limit.  In
              POSIX Mode 512-byte blocks are used for the `-c' and `-f' options.

       [1mumask [22m[[1m-p[22m] [[1m-S[22m] [[4mmode[24m]
              The user file-creation mask is set to [4mmode[24m.  If [4mmode[24m begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an  octal
              number;  otherwise  it  is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by [4mchmod[24m(1).  If
              [4mmode[24m is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.  The [1m-S [22moption causes the mask to be  printed
              in  symbolic  form;  the  default  output is an octal number.  If the [1m-p [22moption is supplied, and [4mmode[24m is
              omitted, the output is in a form that may be reused as input.  The return status is 0 if  the  mode  was
              successfully changed or if no [4mmode[24m argument was supplied, and false otherwise.

       [1munalias [22m[-[1ma[22m] [[4mname[24m ...]
              Remove  each  [4mname[24m  from  the  list  of  defined  aliases.  If [1m-a [22mis supplied, all alias definitions are
              removed.  The return value is true unless a supplied [4mname[24m is not a defined alias.

       [1munset [22m[-[1mfv[22m] [-[1mn[22m] [[4mname[24m ...]
              For each [4mname[24m, remove the corresponding variable or function.  If the [1m-v  [22moption  is  given,  each  [4mname[0m
              refers  to a shell variable, and that variable is removed.  Read-only variables may not be unset.  If [1m-f[0m
              is specified, each [4mname[24m refers to a shell function, and the function definition is removed.  If  the  [1m-n[0m
              option  is  supplied,  and [4mname[24m is a variable with the [4mnameref[24m attribute, [4mname[24m will be unset rather than
              the variable it references.  [1m-n [22mhas no effect if the [1m-f [22moption is supplied.  If no options are supplied,
              each  [4mname[24m  refers  to  a variable; if there is no variable by that name, any function with that name is
              unset.  Each unset variable or function is removed from the environment passed to  subsequent  commands.
              If  any  of  [1mCOMP_WORDBREAKS[22m, [1mRANDOM[22m, [1mSECONDS[22m, [1mLINENO[22m, [1mHISTCMD[22m, [1mFUNCNAME[22m, [1mGROUPS[22m, or [1mDIRSTACK [22mare unset,
              they lose their special properties, even if they are subsequently reset.  The exit status is true unless
              a [4mname[24m is readonly.

       [1mwait [22m[[1m-n[22m] [[4mn[24m [4m...[24m]
              Wait  for each specified child process and return its termination status.  Each [4mn[24m may be a process ID or
              a job specification; if a job spec is given, all processes in that job's pipeline are waited for.  If  [4mn[0m
              is  not  given,  all currently active child processes are waited for, and the return status is zero.  If
              the [1m-n [22moption is supplied, [1mwait [22mwaits for any job to terminate and returns its exit status.  If [4mn[24m speci‚Äê
              fies  a non-existent process or job, the return status is 127.  Otherwise, the return status is the exit
              status of the last process or job waited for.
